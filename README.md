# Final Project: JPEG vs JPEG 2000 Comparison

## Introduction
This project by Hunter and Gustavo aims to compare the loading times and display qualities of JPEG and JPEG 2000 images. It includes a Flask web application that allows users to view different image formats.

## Features
- Display Baseline JPEG images.
- Show Progressive JPEG images.
- Simulate Hierarchical loading of JPEG images.
- Compare JPEG with JPEG 2000 counterparts.

To run this project, you need to have Python and Flask installed. Follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
```
git clone https://github.com/H-Bombmxpwr/license-plate-deblur.git
cd license-plate-deblur
```

2. Set up a virtual environment (optional but recommended):
```
python3 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
```

3. Install the required dependencies:
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

4. Run the Flask application:
```
python app.py
```

## Usage
Once the application is running, navigate to `http://localhost:5000` in your web browser. You will see a home page with links to different image formats.
